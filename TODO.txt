- factor out skipping of classes in two Strategies; SkippingStrategy or DontFollowStrategy
-- interface SkippingStrategy
-- NamespaceSkippingStrategy
-- AlreadyVisitedSkippingStrategy
- depth limit

- ideas
-- interfaces displaying (type hints on constructor|setters)
--- maybe we should stop at the implementor of the interface, not going further
-- multiple fields pointing to same class (rare)
-- following arrays or Traversable objects
